# Navigation Mode

## Introduction

Navigation mode is based on the longitudinal mode and provides a workflow for measurement tracking with navigation capabilities. This mode allows you to:

- Draw annotations and have them shown in the measurement panel
- Create a report from the tracked measurement and export them as DICOM SR
- Use already exported DICOM SR to re-hydrate the measurements in the viewer
- Track measurements across studies with navigation support

## Features

This mode extends the basic mode with:
- Measurement tracking functionality
- Navigation panels and tools
- Registration panel for study alignment
- Screw management tools
- DICOM SR read/write support

## Route

The navigation mode is accessible at the `/navigation` route.
